# Floating Cart Icon Removal

## Overview
Removed the floating cart icon (FAB - Floating Action Button) from the customer interface while maintaining the header cart icon for a cleaner user experience.

## Problem Statement
The floating cart icon was positioned in the bottom-right corner of the screen, which could be:
- Visually distracting
- Taking up screen real estate
- Redundant with the header cart icon
- Potentially interfering with content

## Solution
Removed the floating cart icon completely while keeping the header cart icon functional.

## Changes Made

### **App.js**
- Removed import for `CartFloatingButton`
- Removed the conditional rendering of `CartFloatingButton`
- Updated comment to reflect the change

```diff
- import CartFloatingButton from "./components/customer/CartFloatingButton";

- {isCustomerRoute && <CartFloatingButton />}
```

## Benefits

### **Cleaner Interface**
- Less visual clutter
- More screen space for content

### **Consistent Navigation**
- Single cart access point (header)
- Consistent with standard web patterns
- Better mobile experience

### **Reduced Redundancy**

## Cart Access Remains Available

Users can still access the cart through:
- **Header Cart Icon**: Located in the customer header
- **Add to Cart Buttons**: On individual voucher pages
- **Cart Popup**: Still functional for cart management

## Files Modified

## Result
